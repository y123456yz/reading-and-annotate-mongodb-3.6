MongoDB 加锁时，有四种模式【MODE_IS、MODE_IX、MODE_S、MODE_X】，MODE_S， MODE_X 很容易理解，分别是互斥读锁、
互斥写锁，MODE_IS、MODE_IX是为了实现层次锁模型引入的，称为意向读锁、意向写锁，锁之间的竞争情况如上图所示。

MongoDB在加锁时，是一个层次性的管理方式，从 globalLock ==> DBLock ==> CollecitonLock … ，比如我们都知道
MongoDB wiredtiger是文档级别锁，那么读写并发时，加锁就类似如下

写操作

1. globalLock  (这一层只关注是读还是写，不关注具体是什么LOCK)
2. DBLock MODE_IX
3. Colleciotn MODE_IX
4. pass request to wiredtiger

读操作
1. globalLock MODE_IS  (这一层只关注是读还是写，不关注具体是什么LOCK)
2. DBLock MODE_IS
3. Colleciton MODE_IS
4. pass request to wiredtiger
根据上图的竞争情况，IS和IX是无需竞争的，所以读写请求可以在没有竞争的情况下，同时传到wiredtiger引擎去处理。

再举个栗子，如果一个前台建索引的操作跟一个读请求并发了

前台建索引操作

1. globalLock MODE_IX (这一层只关注是读还是写，不关注具体是什么LOCK)
2. DBLock MODE_X
3. pass to wiredtiger

读操作
1. globalLock MODE_IS (这一层只关注是读还是写，不关注具体是什么LOCK)
2. DBLock MODE_IS
3. Colleciton MODE_IS
4. pass request to wiredtiger
根据竞争表，MODE_X和MODE_IS是要竞争的，这也就是为什么前台建索引的过程中读是被阻塞的。

我们今天介绍的 globalLock 对应上述的第一步，在globalLock这一层，只关心是读锁、还是写锁，不关心是互斥锁还是意向锁，
所以 globalLock 这一层是不存在竞争的。

所有的锁都是平等的，它们是排在一个队列里，符合FIFO原则。但是，MongoDB做了优化，即当一个锁被采用时，
所有与它兼容的锁都会被采纳，从而可以并发操作。举个例子，当你针对Collection A中
的Document a使用S锁时，其它reader可以同时使用S锁来读取该Document a，也可以同时读取同一个Collection
的Document b.因为所有的S锁都是兼容的。那么，如果此时针对Collection A中的Document c进行写操作是否可
以呢？显然需要为Document c赋予x锁，此时Collection A就需要IX锁，而由于IX和IS是兼容的，所以没有问题。
简单来说，只要不是同一个Document，读写操作是可以并发的；如果是同一个Document，读可以并发，但写不可以。
